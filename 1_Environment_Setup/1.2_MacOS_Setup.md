*_We recommend using Docker containers during futureproof - and beyond!_* \
*_For more details on other options for local env setup for MacOS, check out the [Optional](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/MacOS-Setup#Optional) section below._*
***

# Dev Environment Setup: MacOS
_Please note this is designed for MacOS Catalina. If you are on a different version, you may need to refer to external materials if you come across any issues!_

### VS Code
There are plenty of options for code editors and you are welcome to use any alternatives. Your instructors will be using VS Code which is a very popular and extendable offering.
- Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Preparing: 
### Install Xcode Command Line Tools
In your terminal run: `xcode-select --install` 
If you hit any issues, download directly from [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools) (select the most recent stable version or the one stated for your OS version).
The installation can take a little time - at least 5 minutes. Grab yourself a tea.

### Install Homebrew
_Note this is not really "essential" but will be very useful!_ \
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager for Mac & Linux applications.
- Run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- Get another cup of tea and let it do its thing, this could take a while.

---

### Connect git to GitHub
- Run: `git version` to see if you have git installed.
- You probably do but if not run: `brew install git` (this is using Homebrew - see [above](#install-homebrew))
- To configure it to connect to your GitHub account run:\
  `git config --global user.email “your@emailadd.com”`\
  `git config --global user.name “yourGithubUsername”`

### Setup an SSH key (and add it to your GitHub account)
- Run: `ssh-keygen` and follow the instructions. If it asks if you want to overwrite, say no.
- Run: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and copy the output.
- Visit the [GitHub SSH keys settings page](https://github.com/settings/keys) in your browser and click ‘New SSH Key’
- Give it a title (anything you want to indicate the machine this key is for) and paste in your key.

### Generate Personal Access Token
We strongly recommend that you set up [two factor authentication (2FA)](https://github.com/settings/security) for your GitHub account - and any other accounts for that matter! \
If you do, you will however need to take one more step when setting up CLI access. \
**NB: From August 21st 2021, all users regardless of auth setup will require a PAT instead of password for CLI access**
- Generate new [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) - *make sure to copy it!*
- Use this instead of your password on prompt when making your first interaction with GitHub from the CLI (should only happen once)
- If you are not being prompted for a password, run `git config --global --unset user.password` and try again!
- Alternatively Mac users may need to follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/getting-started-with-git/updating-credentials-from-the-macos-keychain).

### Test run GitHub!
Add yourself to your cohort roster in [this repo](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_study_notes_hello_github). Roll call!
Note that this repo is used to power our [cohorts website](http://cohorts.getfutureproof.co.uk/) so add your name as you would like it to appear on there!

### Get node locally and install a global package
Although we will use Docker for many things, we will also install node locally for some global use tools that we may use. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) is a great tool that lets us install multiple versions of node and switch between them easily.
- **Install Node Version Manager**
    + In your terminal, run `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash`
    + Confirm the install with `nvm ls`
    + If `nvm ls` gives you an error, see [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) below
    + Install a version of node with `nvm install v<version>` eg. `nvm install v12.19.0`
    + Make it your default version with `nvm alias default <version>` eg. `nvm alias default 12.19.0` and restart your shell
    + You can install as many different versions of node as you like and switch between them with `nvm use <version>` or update your default as shown above
- **Confirm your node installation**
    + In your chosen shell, run `node -v` (you'll have to reopen the shell if you just set a new default in nvm)
    + If you see a version number eg. `v12.19.0` then your install was successful!
    + You should also get version numbers back for `npm -v` and `npx -v`
- **Install your first global node package**
    + `npm install -g laughs`
    + `ha` - wait for a joke!

### Get python locally and discover the Zen of Python
MacOS usually comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed, which is great except that we want Python 3 which is a fair bit different. \
We will take over control of our Python versions by using a tool called `pyenv`
- **Download pyenv using Homebrew**
    + `brew install pyenv` (this is using Homebrew - see [above](#install-homebrew))
- **Update your shell configuration to work with pyenv**
    + Use the [instructions below](#Shell-Configuration-File) to locate and open your shell configuration file
    + Add `eval "$(pyenv init -)"` to the file, save close and reload your shell
- **Install Python 3.9.1 with pyenv and set it as your global default version**
    + At time of writing 3.9.1 is the latest stable version
    + `pyenv install 3.9.1` (we can easily get other versions later on if you want)
    + `pyenv global 3.9.1`
- **Confirm your python installation**
    + In your chosen shell type `python --version`
    + If you see a version number eg. `Python 3.9.1` then your install was successful!
    + You should also get a version number back for `python -m pip --version`
- **Check out the 'Zen of Python'**
    + `python` - to enter a python shell (bye, bash!)
    + `import this` - this will show you the Zen of Python!
    + `exit()` - to exit the python shell

***

### Install Docker
- Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Test your install from the command line by running `docker run hello-world`

***

## Shell Configuration File
You may find that you need to add some things to your shell configuration file as you update and evolve your environment over time. The exact name of this file will depend on the shell you have chosen to use. Bash configuration files are usually called `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` whilst zsh ones are generally `.zshrc`. The dot at the beginning means it is a hidden file!

**To access the file**
- In your shell run `cd ~` which will take you to your home directory
- Run `ls -lah` to see all the files (even hidden ones) in the directory
- In the printed list of files, you are looking for a file called something like `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zprofile` or `.profile`
    + If it does not exist, create it with `touch <filename>` eg. `touch .bashrc`
- Open it in a text editor of your choice
- Make any changes/additions you need
- After making changes, **make sure you reload your shell** by closing and reopening or running `source ~/<config-filename>` eg `source ~/.zshrc`

- Restart your shell

***

## Troubleshooting
### NVM Installation
If the curl command above does not successfully complete the install, you'll need to add some code to your shell configuration file.
- See the [instructions above](#Shell-Configuration-File) on how to locate and open your configuration file.
- Into that file, paste the following:
```
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```
- Save the file and reload your shell
- NVM should now work, test it with `nvm ls`

### Admin/permissions errors
If you are getting permissions errors, you may be using an account which does not have full owner access to the computer's filesystem. If you know that you should (ie. it is your machine or the original owner does not mind you having owner access), you can run the following:
- `cd ~`
- `sudo chown -R <your-username> .`
    + If you are not sure what your username is, it is usually visible in your terminal prompt

### zsh compinit errors
Sometimes zsh gets wrongly suspicious of your files! You can disable this 'feature' by adding the following to your `.zshrc` file (see 'Shell Configuration File' above)
- `ZSH_DISABLE_COMPFIX="true"`
- Save the file and reload your shell
