React and building a slick user interface is the main focus of this LAP. We'll cover all the nuances of the library like components and props, as well as managing state. To help with your use of React we will introduce you to Redux and how testing in React differs from what you've already learned. We'll finish LAP 3 with an overview of DevOps, a useful subject to know as you move into the industry.
