We started out by building our Django app using Function-based Views with good reason! This was originally the only way to build in Django and is still incredibly useful to know. However, as Django grew, Class-based Views were introduced as a way to speed up development. Their usefulness is at it's peak when writing tried and tested functionality built in many applications. Class-based views are a potentially more elegant way of writing a Django app, condensing boilerplate code into pre-built classes that can be reused and extended.

This tutorial will cover some of the most common uses, building upon what we learned in the [Django tutorial](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Django).

Take a look at the official documentation for a better understanding of the full extent and power of Django's [Class-based Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/). ðŸ’»

## Template View

This is one of the easiest views to implement and it does a lot of the heavy lifting for us.

```python
# adoption/views.py

from django.views.generic import TemplateView, ListView

...

class AboutView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'adoption/about.html'
```

As you can see below we are extending the `TemplateView` to create one of our own, passing it the name of the template we want to display. This will look for a a template folder, and find a match.

Then we simply need to update our URLs, passing the class instead of the function.

```python
# adoption/urls.py

from .views import AboutView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', AboutView.as_view(), name='adoption-about'),
```
***
## List View

Displaying a list of objects is common for an app or API so Django gives us an easy way to do so with the `ListView`.

```python
# adoption/views.py

from django.views.generic import ListView

...

class DoggosList(ListView):

    model = Dog
    context_object_name = 'dogs'
```

Again we are extending the Django class, this time passing the model we want to use. As this is a list view, Django infers that we want to display all objects associated with this model and again does the rest. We have changed the name of our template to `dog_list.html` as Django will look for a template named `model_list.html`. We can specify the template name if we wish, as we saw above. 

By default Django will pass the objects to the template with a name of `object_list`, which is fine but not particularly descriptive semantically. This is why we have instructed that the objects be passed with the name of `dogs`, so that we can iterate over the list in a more readable way: `for dog in dogs`.

Remember the last thing we need to do is update our URLs.

```python
# adoption/urls.py

from .views import DoggosList, AboutView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', DoggosList.as_view(), name='adoption-home'),
    path('about/', AboutView.as_view(), name='adoption-about'),
...
```
***
## Form View

Although forms do have a class of their own, they also work well with a standard `View` which expects a `GET` and `POST` method, which is worth having a look at.

```python
# adoption/views.py

from django.views.generic import View, TemplateView, ListView

from .forms import NewDogForm, AdoptDogForm
...

class NewDogFormView(View):
    form_class = NewDogForm
    template_name = 'dogs/new.html'

    def get(self, request):
        form = self.form_class
        return render(request, self.template_name, {'form': form})

    def post(self, request):
        form = self.form_class(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            dog_id = form.save().id
            return HttpResponseRedirect(f'/dogs/{dog_id}')

        return render(request, self.template_name, {'form': form})
```

Since the template and form is being used in a few places, we can define them at the top of the class. We have also removed the need to us conditional statements to determine the method as Django will do this for us. The rest of the code block should be fairly familiar.

See if you can implement a [FormView](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/generic-editing/) instead.

As always, let's also update the URLs.

```python
# adoption/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import DoggosList, AboutView, NewDogFormView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', DoggosList.as_view(), name='adoption-home'),
    path('about/', AboutView.as_view(), name='adoption-about'),
    path('dogs/new/', NewDogFormView.as_view(), name='dog-create'),
```
***
## Detail View

Moving on to the detail view, again we are going to use a standard `View` here, in the main because this combines both a detail view and a list view.

```python
# adoption/views.py

class DogDetailView(View):
    model = Dog
    form_class = AdoptDogForm
    template_name = 'dogs/show.html'

    def get(self, request, dog_id):
        dog = get_object_or_404(Dog, pk=dog_id)
        form = self.form_class(initial={'owner': request.user})
        return render(request, self.template_name, {'dog': dog, 'form': form})

    def post(self, request, dog_id):
        dog = get_object_or_404(Dog, pk=dog_id)
        form = self.form_class(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            dog.owner = request.user
            dog.save()
            return HttpResponseRedirect(f'/dogs/{dog_id}')
        return render(request, self.template_name, {'dog': dog, 'form': form})
```

The main thing to point out here is applying the initial value for the form on our 'GET' method, which autopopulates the owner field if the user wishes to adopt the dog. The form validation remains the same.

Remember those URLs.

```python
# adoption/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import DoggosList, AboutView, NewDogFormView, DogDetailView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', DoggosList.as_view(), name='adoption-home'),
    path('about/', AboutView.as_view(), name='adoption-about'),
    path('dogs/new/', NewDogFormView.as_view(), name='dog-create'),
    path('dogs/<int:dog_id>/', DogDetailView.as_view() , name='dog-show')
]
```
## Register View

As we are making use of Django's authorisation views, we don't need to touch `Login` and `Logout`, so the last view we are going to tweak is the Register view.

Login and Logout can stay the same.
```python
# users/views.py

from django.views.generic import View

class UserSignupFormView(View):
    form_class = UserSignupForm
    template_name = 'users/signup.html'

    def get(self, request):
        form = self.form_class
        return render(request, self.template_name, {'form': form})

    def post(self, request):
        form = self.form_class(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('login')
        return render(request, 'users/signup.html', {'form': form})
```

Now that we have already created another form, the implementation of this is really straight forward.

The final URL also needs adjusting.

```python
# shelter/urls.py

...
from users.views import UserSignupFormView
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

urlpatterns = [
...
    path('signup/', UserSignupFormView.as_view(), name='signup'),
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='users/login.html'), name='login'),
    path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(template_name='users/logout.html'), name='logout')
```
***
## Protected View

With the ability to `Register`, `Login` and `Logout`, we should protect some of our views. This has similarities but important differences to how we have gone about this before. We can't simply apply a function decorator anymore to let Django know we require users to login to use these routes, instead we have to build a method decorator. We could decorate the class itself to protect specific methods within, but since we want users to be logged-in to use both `GET` and `POST` methods, we will use an instance method and decorate that instead.

Take a look [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/intro/) for more information.

```python
from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
...
class NewDogFormView(View):
    form_class = NewDogForm
    template_name = 'dogs/new.html'

    @method_decorator(login_required)
    def dispatch(self, request, **kwargs):
        return super(NewDogFormView, self).dispatch(request, **kwargs)

    def get(self, request):
        form = self.form_class
        return render(request, self.template_name, {'form': form})

    def post(self, request):
        form = self.form_class(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            dog_id = form.save().id
            return HttpResponseRedirect(f'/dogs/{dog_id}')

        return render(request, self.template_name, {'form': form})
...
```
Note that we have included `**kwargs` as we know that we will be expecting `dog_id` along with the request.

**That's a quick demonstration of Class-based views, why not give it a go!**
