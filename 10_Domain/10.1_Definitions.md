# Custom domains
A domain name is the URL or web address where visitors find your site.

By default, any site on Netlify is accessible from its Netlify subdomain, which has the form ```[name-of-your-site].netlify.app```. For example, you would access a site named brave-curie-12345 at ```https://brave-curie-12345.netlify.app/```.

Custom domains allow you to make your sites accessible at your own, non-Netlify domain names (for example, ```www.yourcustomdomain.com``` or ```docs.example.dev```). Netlify supports all top-level domains in custom domains.
