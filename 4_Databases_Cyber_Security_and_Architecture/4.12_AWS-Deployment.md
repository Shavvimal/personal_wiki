There are numerous options for deployment with the ubiquitous AWS. Offering differing levels of customisation and pricing options, some good options for your applications include:

### EC2

EC2 is the classic AWS instance service. Most of the other services actually spin up EC2 instances eventually. If you reach directly for an EC2 instance, you have complete control over all parts of the instance you create. Highly configurable and with various billing options including on-demand to only pay for the time the instance is running.

### Lightsail

Lightsail offers a friendly, easy to understand service to create instances. Monthly costs are clearly laid out at the start for no surprises.

### Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk is a free service designed to allow developers to upload their code and allow AWS to work out and configure the appropriate services to run the application. Note that whilst Elastic Beanstalk is free to use, the services it selects may have costs involved.
